# banner.py does the selenium interface to banner
# transcript.py does transcript parsing and handling
# award-report.py
#   produces a report called 'reportfile.txt' and also sends all the transcript
#   information to stdout

Doing this with Chrome as of 2018, since Safari's automation tools don't
allow user to help out, and the user needs to help to get through SLU
authentication.

As a positive, Java and the selenium standalone server are no longer required!

First, in one command line window run:
`chromedriver`
(this can be installed via homebrew with 'brew install chromedriver')

Then run:

   cat idfile | python award-report.py http://localhost:4444/wd/hub bryan unusedpassword > transcriptfile.txt

Here, 4444 should be the port number reported by chromedriver when run.

Once the window opens, it goes to Banner.  You need to proceed through the
login process by hand, within 120 seconds.
As soon as you hit the Banner 'Main Menu' screen, the script takes over again.

The script produces transcripts on stdout (sent to transcriptfile.txt) and a second file called reportfile.txt with the student summary reports in it.  It also produces a pile of temp files with the raw html banner transcripts for every student.


Notes:
Major GPAs not working properly, try 000355677 to see the MATH GPA go wrong 
Well, this warning is from 2014 and in 2016 I rewrote everything and didn't
check this
Ha ha, Bryan of 2016.  Bryan of 2017 tested 000355677 who had a W in one class,
and it seems to be working fine.
